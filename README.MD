## 🔧 Setup Instructions

> To run any file:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-in-CPP.git
   cd DSA-in-CPP
````

3. Compile and run a file:

   ```bash
   g++ path/to/your_file.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## 🚀 Purpose

* ✅ Strengthen problem-solving skills.
* ✅ Build core DSA understanding.
* ✅ Practice for **coding interviews**, **online judges** like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, etc.
* ✅ Learn and revise with well-commented C++ solutions.

Would you like:
- A version with emojis removed for a cleaner professional look?
- A template for a **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** or **folder-specific README** (like for Graph or DP)?
- A badge-based top section (GitHub stars, issues, etc.)?

Let me know if you want to publish it on GitHub and need help customizing it further.
